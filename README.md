Now we can check the newly created files in `/dist`

Here you should see a bunch of js files. 

 * `neb.js`:Used in browser side. Including outside dependency.
 * `neb-light.js`:Used in Repl console. Not including outside dependency.

## Usage
`neb.js` is a useful library for nebulas developers. It provides rich underlying support in web and node.js's dapp. It implements the following functions.

* The RPC interface for the nebulas node is encapsulated;
* Create and manage the private key and address of the nebulas;
* Generate the transaction object and sign the transaction.

The use of neb.js can be used as examples:

* [web-example](example/example.html) 
* [nodejs-example](example/node-example.js)

## Extra 
Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application.

Next step go to the neb.js folder in your Nebulas dir and
Build neb-node.js by using [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/):

```
rollup -c
```
